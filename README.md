# Bayesian Design of Experiments for GLMs

Code used in the undergraduate thesis *Bayesian Design of Experiments for Generalized Linear Models* by Gian Carlo Di-Luvi Martínez (2018). 

The code implements Overstall and Woods' Approximate Coordinate Exchange (ACE) algorithm for finding optimal bayesian experimental designs (Overstall and Woods, 2016), particularly by using Overstall, Woods and Adamou's *R* package `acebayes`. It also produces graphs with Wickham's `ggplot2` and Schloerke et al.'s `GGally`.
